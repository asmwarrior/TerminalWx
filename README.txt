This is a wxWidgets Terminal widget conveniently packaged for you.

TerminalWx is taken (with modifications) from the Chameleon IDE (Mark 
Erikson), which itself took (with modifications) from taTelnet (Derry 
Bryson), which itself took (with modifications) from GTerm (Timothy 
Miller).  So this code has a bit of history ;).  All credit to those 
before me, the amount I've contributed is relatively nothing.

It is offered under the terms of the GPL version 2, or at your choice, 
any later version (see gpl-2.0.txt for details on version 2 of the GPL)
